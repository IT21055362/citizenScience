#### Brief Description of Project - Our project focuses on SDG Goal 14: Life Below Water. We have developed a reporting site where citizens can log in as citizen scientists and report instances of marine litter and dead animals. Approved reports receive badges assigned by the admin. Citizen scientists can view and interact with the reports through a dedicated feed. Our organization also organizes events to clean up, raise awareness, and raise funds to tackle this issue. Together, we aim to combat marine litter and protect our oceans.

#### Technologies used - MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
